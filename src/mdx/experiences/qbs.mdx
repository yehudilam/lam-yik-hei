Full stack development, from website, CMS, CRM, android apps to backend systems. Clients include real estate developer (Henderson Land), logistic service providers (Kerry, DHL, Alfred), HK government agencies (EMSD, TDC), utilities company (CLP), Casablanca, FlexSystem and many other companies in various industries. Here are some details for the projects I have involved:

- **Shopping mall CRM and Logistic service provider admin portal**: developed with React.js, Restful API, and frontend libraries such as tailwind CSS, material-UI and Metronic. Liaise with both internal and external parties on business requirements and API interfaces. Deploy frontend to different environments.
- **CLP**: Frontend development with React.js, tailwind, material-UI and GraphQL. Embedded to CLP dev team, with scrum rituals and code review. Product is a dashboard for displaying various sensor readings of a premises over a period of time, with the ability to group and filter by many different attributes, so that estate management would know how to improve energy efficiencies and indoor air quality.
- **Government agencies**: Full stack development with PHP Laravel.
Project for **EMSD** was used for medical equipment maintenance logging. The part I was responsible involved the backend API and the admin portal. There was also an app, which was not done by me, for the engineers to fill in while they perform preventive maintenance.
Project for **TDC** was an online exhibition, where extensive enhancement was done to ensure quick loading and low server costs
- **FlexSystem Acube Alpha Connect**: BLE Mobile apps development with Kotlin, mainly used for HR purposes with the help of Bluetooth beacons. There were two apps, one for the employees to clock in and out, using combinations Bluetooth and photo taking; another one is an app for the HR admin to manage their employees.
- **DHL**: BLE Android SDK for tracking employees movement inside an indoor warehouse, written with Java.
- **E-commerce platform plugin development for Alfred**: This is a full stack project with Express.js and MySQL as backend, Docker for deployment and Vue.js as Frontend. Vuetify is also used for styling. This plugin enables shop owners to add Alfred as a shipping method as simple as installing a plugin. There were two Frontend components, one for checkout page, one for admin panel, where the shop owner can configure the plugin. One backend server was required to communicate between Alfred API, Shopify API and respond to request made by customers on checkout.
- **CarbonCoins**: Reverse vending machine admin portal, developed with React, Ant Design. The portal was extensive, from integrating google maps, kiosk real time management, to barcode database.
