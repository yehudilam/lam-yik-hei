This was a [shopify plugin](https://apps.shopify.com/alfred-click-collect) for Alfred, a logistic service provider.

Once installed, the plug-in allows customers to choose and collect what they have bought from a list of locations provided by Alfred. The module involves communicating between Shopify APIs and Alfred APIs, as well as a layout that matches the Shopify shipment and admin pages.
