[Carbon coins](https://carboncoins.com.hk/) is a network of Reverse vending machines (RVM). It encourages people to recycle plastic bottles by providing incentives, carboncoins, which can be exchanged for discounts in different merchants.
I was responsible for the admin panel managing the network of machines, as well as different configurations for the network, for example, the list of barcodes that will be accepted, merchant rewards settings.
