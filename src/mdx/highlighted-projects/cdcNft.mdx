I joined [crypto.com](http://crypto.com) with the NFT Team, which by then was still under rapid expansion and development. I was responsible for both frontend (client-facing UI and admin panel) and backend, as well as supporting the product operations.

Team members located all across south-east Asia, though majority was located in HK.
