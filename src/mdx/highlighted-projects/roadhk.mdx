This is the first side project that I started. Back then, estimated time of arrival (ETA) and route data for buses in Hong Kong are not that open, and different operators have their own standards.

The [site](https://roadhk.com) was set up as a unified dashboard for searching bus routes, suggesting routes to take and displaying ETA for different bus operators in Hong Kong. However, maintaining this site has becoming more difficult since the open data from Transport Department is often outdated, or there are some missing stops or extra stops. And that different operators still have their own data standards. Although the data are all open to public, developers still have to do some data conversion between the government, and different operators, which is quite time consuming.
