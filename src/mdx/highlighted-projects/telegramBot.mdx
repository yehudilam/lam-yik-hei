This is a side project I started a few years ago, when Hong Kong government decided to open more and more data for public access. It started as a bot that relay Hong Kong Observatory warnings and radar images (mainly for checking if a rainstorm is approaching). As more and more data is available, I have added more functions, such as getting weather photos, which gives an idea of how the sky looks like, real time, and whether the dusk or dawn will look great, and traffic departmentâ€™s traffic cameras, which covers major trunks routes. More functions are constantly added when my friends found some useful online resources.

The bot is @captureinfo2_bot, which you may find it useful if you are in Hong Kong.
