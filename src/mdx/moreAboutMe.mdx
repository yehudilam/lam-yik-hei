Hi, I am Lam Yik Hei, Yehudi. I started self-learning web development 6 years ago when I was working in the university after graduation. Then I started my first position as a developer in Trifectah where I got some real nice colleague to learn from. And while in QBS System, I was involved in a lot of different projects, from web frontend to backend, to android Apps with BLE, as well as quite a few proof of concepts.

Here is the website ([https://roadhk.com](https://roadhk.com)) I built a few years ago. It aimed to provide Hong Kong public transport information and ETA, with the data from government open data initiatives. It was written by vue.js and PHP laravel, and mainly in Chinese as it is intended for my friends in Hong Kong.

Other than web development. I also enjoyed the fabulous countryside of Hong Kong, which was a stark contrast with the common impression of a crowded, highly efficient concrete jungle. The cover photos was taken at one of the most challenging routes, Kau Nga Ling, Lantau, on a hot summer day back in 2014. Below are some other remarkable countryside landmark in Hong Kong that I have collected and will definitely miss
